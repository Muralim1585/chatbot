# chatbot
This is my first contact with building chatbots. All codes are adapted from the "Building Chatbots in Python" DataCamp's course.

You can find instructions to install Python in https://www.python.org/downloads/. I used Python 3 to write the codes.

To execute the programs in the command line, you must head to the direcotry of the file and write `python file_name.py`.
